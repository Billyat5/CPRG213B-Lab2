            <h2>Story about Beef Wellington</h2>
            <p>Beef Wellington, originated from England, is one of Gordan Ramsay's famous dishes. I once tasted beef wellington at Gordon's restaurant and it was one of the best meal of my life. It is also difficult to cook one at  home as it involves a lot of steps.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 center cut beef Tenderloin Roast, chain removed (about 1.5-2 pounds)</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>8 ounces baby bella mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 large shallot</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry red wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, minced</li>
            <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry (1/2 package), thawed</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Season beef tenderloin with salt and pepper. Press evenly onto all surfaces of beef roast.</li>
            <li>2. Heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in large nonstick skillet on medium-high heat until hot. Place roast in skillet; brown evenly. Remove roast from skillet.</li>
            <li>3. Preheat oven to 425°F. Place mushrooms and shallot into food processor; pulse on and off about 10 times until finely chopped. Do not over process.</li>
            <li>4. Heat remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil in same skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add mushrooms and shallot; cook 4 to 6 minutes until tender and all liquid is evaporated, stirring often. Add wine; cook 2 to 3 minutes until all liquid is evaporated again. Stir in mustard, thyme, and a pinch of ground black pepper. Cook 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from skillet to medium bowl; cool.</li>
            <li>5. Unfold puff pastry dough on lightly floured cutting board. Roll pastry out to 12 by 9-inch rectangle; lay dough with shortest edge toward you. Spread mushroom mixture onto pastry dough, leaving 1/2-inch border around edge of dough. Place roast in center of mushrooms. Fold pastry neatly around roast, stretching dough if necessary. Tug in the excess pastry under the roast.</li>
            <li>6. Brush an beaten egg onto the beef wellington; brush and press to seal overlapping edges. Dust a baking sheet lightly with flour. Place pastry-wrapped roast, seam-side down, on baking sheet. Cut 3-4 (2-inch) vents in top of pastry. Decorate with heart-shaped</li>
            <li>7. Bake in 425°F oven 35 to 50 minutes or until golden brown and instant read thermometer inserted into center of roast registers 135°F for medium rare; 150°F for medium. Transfer Beef Wellington to a carving board. Let stand 10 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise about 10°F to reach 145°F for medium rare; 160°F for medium.) Carve into slices and serve with your favorite vegetables. Enjoy!</li>
